## [0.7.0] — 2026-07-13

### Highlights

- Reached full parity with `@inkjs/ui` by porting its four remaining components: `EmailInput`, `PasswordInput`, `UnorderedList`, and `OrderedList`, all exported from the package root and covered by vitest suites ([b6bddce](https://github.com/kud/ink-ui/commit/b6bddcedd1dcf716eb5ddae186b5062281d5f8ea)).
  - `EmailInput` completes the domain for you — press Tab to accept a suggested domain instead of typing it out.
  - `PasswordInput` masks each keystroke with a configurable character, so secrets typed into a TUI prompt never echo to the screen.
  - `UnorderedList` and `OrderedList` render nested lists correctly — bullets step through depth-aware markers (●, ○, ▪, ▫) and numbered lists reset their counter at each nesting level.
